# CarMatch 🚗

![CarMatch demo](/public/carmatch-demo.gif)

**CarMatch** is an experimental web application that reimagines car browsing using a **swipe-based, one-card-at-a-time interface**, inspired by modern interaction patterns.

Instead of scrolling through long lists of listings, CarMatch focuses on **fast decisions, minimal UI, and a frictionless browsing experience**.

## ✨ What is CarMatch?

CarMatch presents **real car listings** in a Tinder-style interface:

- One car displayed at a time
- Swipe (or use buttons) to move forward
- No repetition of already seen cars
- No heavy filters or clutter

The project is focused on **UX experimentation**, not data ownership or building a full marketplace.

---

## 🎯 Why this exists

Traditional car platforms rely on:

- long lists
- complex filters
- cognitive overload

CarMatch explores a different question:

> _What if browsing cars felt more like discovery than searching?_

This project serves as a playground for:

- UX and interaction design experiments
- frontend performance trade-offs
- swipe-based navigation patterns
- working with real-world data without backend ownership

---

> ⚠️ CarMatch does **not** own or modify listing data.  
> All data is fetched and displayed purely for UX experimentation.
